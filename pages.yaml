It is the country's artistic, cultural, economic and political centre. It is known for its high living standards, relaxed yet elegant lifestyle and rich musical life.\n\nVienna, renowned as the former seat of the Habsburg court and its diverse empires, stands not only as a grand metropolis but also as a historical center that has perpetually thrived with a substantial population. This city's distinction lies in its privileged stature, fostering an environment that has nurtured numerous eminent artists, notably Beethoven, Haydn, Liszt, Mozart, Schubert, and Johann Strauss II, among others. It was long the largest German-speaking city in the world before being surpassed by [[Berlin]]. The large historic city centre of Vienna filled with monuments to its imperial past is inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n\n==Districts==\nVienna is broadly divided in inner (1–9) and outer districts (10–23). The 23 districts or wards each have a name and a number. They vary immensely in size and each has its own flair. These function subordinately to the city as decentralized administrative branches of the commune, and make local decisions.\n\nWikivoyage has divided the 23 official districts of Vienna into 13 here for travel purposes.\n\n{{Mapframe|48.21650|16.38063|width=600|height=500|zoom=11|show=mask,go|staticmap=Vienna Wikivoyage Map.png}}\n{{Mapshape|type=page|wikicommons=Vienna Districts.map}}\n\n{{Mapshapes|Q209400}} &lt;!--U-bahn --&gt;\n\n{{Regionlist\n| region1name=[[Vienna/Innere Stadt|Innere Stadt (1)]]\n| region1color=#d5dc76\n| region1items=\n| region1description=The central Old Town and most important part of the city where most sights and tourists can be found.\n\n| region2name=[[Vienna/Landstraße|Landstraße (3)]]\n| region2color=#ac9393\n| region2items=\n| region2description=The third district is the largest inner district including the Belvedere Palace, the Schwarzenbergplatz, embassies and an industrial hinterland.\n\n| region3name= [[Vienna/Wieden|Wieden (4)]]\n| region3color=#c7b49d\n| region3items=\n| region3description=The fourth district starts from Karlsplatz with the famous Karlskirche and borders the Naschmarkt with a miniature Chinatown.\n\n| region4name= [[Vienna/Margareten|Margareten (5)]]\n| region4color=#ac5c91\n| region4items=\n| region4description=The outermost inner district is mostly a residential area.\n\n| region5name=[[Vienna/Mariahilf|Mariahilf (6)]]\n| region5color=#d09440\n| region5items=\n| region5description=The sixth district continues on from the Naschmarkt up to the Mariahilfer Straße.

Vienna's own recorded history began with '''[[Roman Empire|the Romans]],''' who founded it in the 1st century CE as ''Vindobona,'' one of a line of Roman defensive outposts against Germanic tribes. Vindobona's central garrison was on the site of what is now the Hoher Markt (the &quot;High Market&quot; so-called because of its relative height over the Danube), and you can still see astounding excavations of its foundations there today.\n\nGiven its prestige, Vienna hosted the '''Habsburg court''' for several centuries, first as the Imperial seat of the Holy Roman Empire, then the capital of the Austrian Empire, and later of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which finally fell in 1918 with the abdication of the last Emperor Karl I. The court tremendously influenced the culture that exists here even today: Vienna's residents are often overly formal, with small doses of courtliness, polite forms of address, and formal dress attire. One distinguishable paradox of the quirky city is that its residents can be equally modern and progressive as they are extremely old-fashioned.\n\n[[File:Roman ruins Hofburg Dec 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Vienna existed even as early as the ancient Roman Empire – the ruins of what was then called ''Vindobona'' can be seen right in the city centre.]]\n\nThe empires also served to make Vienna a very '''metropolitan city''' at an early time, and especially so through the years of industrialization and fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the turn of the 20th century. Imperial Austria and Austro-Hungary were multilingual, multi-ethnic empires and although the German speakers normally played the dominant role in Vienna there has long been ethnic and linguistic diversity in the city. Proof of '''Jews''' in the city dates back to 10th century. After World War II many of the city's minorities had been exiled or killed and much of the city lay in ruin. When Austria was given sovereignty after the post World War II occupation, it was eventually established that Austria would be neutral and not join the Eastern Bloc. So the city became more isolated from its previous ties to its Slavic and Hungarian neighbors; the east of Austria was surrounded by the Iron Curtain. Vienna had gone from being the well-established metropolitan city of Central Europe to the capital of a small, predominately German-speaking nation of states with strong regional identities. But when the Iron Curtain came down in the early 1990s an influx of immigrants and Yugoslav refugees came to Vienna. In 1995 Austria joined the EU and her neighbors to the east joined in 2004. In addition, Vienna became a business hub between Eastern and Western Europe due to its imperial past and location, with many multinational companies having offices and facilities in the city and many Austrian companies investing in Eastern Europe. These series of events helped the city rise from the ashes. Vienna once more sits at the heart rather than at the edge of Central Europe, with connections that had been severed for decades slowly but surely being re-established.\n\nSince the formation of the first Austrian Republic and the first mayoral election 1919, the Social Democratic Party of Austria has had the majority of representatives on the common council and controlled the mayoral seat. During the early years, the socialist '''Red Vienna''' (&quot;[http://www.dasrotewien-waschsalon.at/ Rote Wien]&quot;) revolutionized the city, improving the extreme conditions that the industrial revolution and rapid urbanization had created. Most famously the city built many housing projects (housing estates or &quot;Gemeindebauten&quot;), and they also began to offer many social services and made improvements across the board in quality of life. The public housing that was built at that time is now famous for its distinctive style. To this day the city continues to build public housing and about a third of the city's residents live in it, some 600,000 people! Through this high percentage, the quality, and the integration of public housing across the city have kept it from becoming as stigmatized as in most cities. The Viennese are used to having the city government in their lives, and of course have a love-hate relationship with it. Vienna functions on its own as a federal state in the Austrian system (along with 8 other states) and the sense of local pride and home is more of being Viennese than being Austrian, many say.\n\nVienna was the host city for the [http://eurovision.tv Eurovision Song Contest], Europe's largest live televised event, in May 2015.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Kirche Seitenfront 01.JPG|thumbnail|right|The majestic church in the ''Zentralfriedhof'' is a monument to the importance of death in Viennese culture]]\n'''Traditional Vienna''' is but one of the many façades of this city; the historic center, a UNESCO world heritage site, is sometimes begrudgingly compared to an open-air museum. But Vienna is also a dynamic young city, famous for its (electronic) music scene with independent labels, cult-status underground record stores, a vibrant Monday through Sunday club scene, multitudes of street performers, and a government that seems overly obsessed with complicated paperwork. However, people are willing to go out of their way or bend the rules a little if they feel they can do someone a favor.\n\nThe Viennese have a singular fascination with '''death''', hence the popularity of the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery), where there are more graves than living residents in Vienna, as a strolling location and of Schrammelmusik - highly sentimental music with lyrics pertaining to death. Old-fashioned Sterbevereine (funeral insurance societies-literally translated &quot;death clubs&quot;) provide members with the opportunity to save up for a nice funeral throughout the course of their lives. This service does not exist solely to save their children the hassle and expense - it is considered absolutely mandatory to provide for an adequate burial. Vienna even has the &quot;Bestattungsmuseum&quot;, a museum devoted to coffins and mortuary science. The country’s morbid obsession may be correlated with its higher suicide rate when compared with the rest of Europe. Here too, the socialist Vienna has its hand, the city also offers a [http://www.bestattungwien.at/ socialized undertaking service], with hearses branded in the same department of public works logo as the subway cars, and a link to the transit-planner on their website.\n[[File:Cafe-prueckel-schanigarten.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ever since the Polish king Sobieski gave Vienna the coffee acquired from his victory over the invading Turks, the ''Kaffeehauskultur'' is an integral part of the Viennese lifestyle]]\n\nVienna is also famous for its '''coffee culture.''' &quot;Let's have a coffee&quot; is a very commonly heard phrase, because despite incursions by Starbucks and Italian-style espresso bars, the Kaffeehauskultur is still the traditional way to drink a cup of coffee, read the newspaper, meet friends, or fall in love.\n\n===Orientation===\n[[File:Vienna street sign.JPG|thumb|right|1., An old street [[sign]] with abbreviated district name &quot;Innere Stadt&quot;, which is the 1st district.]]\n\n'''Addresses''' in the Vienna articles are written with the street name following the district name. ''Badgasse 26, Alsergrund'' is Badgasse #26 in the 9th district. One can always tell what district you are in by the first number on street signs. Districts can also be made into a postal code by substituting the XX in ''1XX0 Vienna'' (0X for districts below 10), for instance 1090 Vienna for the 9th district and 1200 the 20th, and are sometimes referred to as such.\n\nCommon '''points of reference''' are often used in Vienna in addition to districts, most notably public transportation stops. Reference to ''U1/U4 Schwedenplatz'' or ''Schwedenplatz (U1, U4)'' means that something is near to the Schwedenplatz stop on the underground lines U1 and U4. Normally if the place is not directly at the subway stop you can ask around and find it easily.\n\nThe '''[http://www.wien.info Vienna Tourist Board]''' operates information and booking booths at the airport Arrival Hall, 07:00-23:00 and the {{marker|type=go|name=Tourist-Info|lat= 48.204493|long=16.369321}} in the centre at 1., Albertinaplatz/Maysedergasse (09:00-19:00). Information and free maps are also available from the ÖBB InfoPoints and offices at train stations.\n\nThe city has a very centralized layout radiating from the historic [[Vienna/Innere Stadt|first district]] with the Stephansdom and Stephansplatz at the centre of a bullseye. It is encircled by the ''Ringstraße'' (Ring Road), a grand boulevard. '''Districts 2-9''' are considered the core districts and are gathered within the ''Gürtel'' (Belt Road), which encircles the core districts as an outer ring concentric to the Ring around the first district, with the notable exception of [[Vienna/Inner East|Leopoldstadt]] (2). The outer 14 districts are largely less urban but are equally as diverse.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Climate\n| units = Metric\n| janhigh =   3\n| febhigh =   5\n| marhigh =   10\n| aprhigh =   15\n| mayhigh =   20\n| junhigh =   23\n| julhigh =   26\n| aughigh =   25\n| sephigh =   20\n| octhigh =   14\n| novhigh =   7\n| dechigh =   4\n| janlow =   -2\n| feblow =   -1\n| marlow =   2\n| aprlow =   6\n| maylow =   10\n| junlow =   13\n| jullow =   15\n| auglow =   15\n| seplow =   12\n| octlow =   7\n| novlow =   2\n| declow =   0\n| janprecip =  37\n| febprecip =  39\n| marprecip =  46\n| aprprecip =  52\n| mayprecip =  62\n| junprecip =  70\n| julprecip =  68\n| augprecip =  58\n| sepprecip =  54\n| octprecip =  40\n| novprecip =  50\n| decprecip =  44\n| description = Averages of Vienna between 1971-2000\n}}\n'''Spring''' starts sometime in late March, normally it is very brief and summer-like weather sets in before the trees have had time to grow back their leaves.\n\n'''Summer''' in Vienna is usually warm. Weather in June is moderate and sunny with a light summer windy breeze. In July and August, there are some hot and humid days where it reaches 35°C (95°F), but overall, summer in Vienna is pleasant.\n\n'''Autumn''' starts around September, although an &quot;Indian Summer&quot; with warm and sunny days often occurs that month and it gets colder as it approaches November. A main disadvantage of the Viennese climate is that it is rather windy and usually overcast during these months.\n\n'''Winter''' in Vienna can be just above 0°C (32°F) and drizzling for days on end, or just below with dustings of snow that manage to melt again quickly. There is the occasional cold snap where it will stay below freezing for a week or two at a time. Due to Vienna's relative easterly position in the Central European Time Zone its daylight hours (if it's not too gray outside entirely) are relatively early during the winter.\n\n===Sunday closures===\nThe vast majority of shops, restaurants, and cafes are closed on Sunday. The main exceptions are shops and restaurants located in train stations, flea markets, a few small family-run outfits, and tourist oriented souvenir shops. Many museums and other attractions are also closed, and the public transportation system runs less frequently and keeps different hours. If you plan to visit anything on Sunday, be sure to check if it will be open. Besides visiting museums and churches, a stroll through the Prater or a hike in the Wienerwald are good Sunday activities.\n\n==Get in==\n[[File:2011-06-14 10-23-56 Austria Niederösterreich Fischamend Markt.jpg|thumbnail|right|Vienna International Airport sees direct flights to Europe, North America and Asia]]\n===By plane===\n\n====Vienna International Airport====\n{{main|Vienna International Airport}}\n* {{listing|type=go\n| name=Vienna International Airport | alt=Flughafen Wien-Schwechat {{IATA|VIE}} | url=http://www.viennaairport.com | email=\n| address= | lat=48.110278 | long=16.569722 | directions=just outside the city limits of Vienna on the far side of the City of Schwechat\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Vienna International Airport | image=2011-06-14 10-23-53 Austria Niederösterreich Fischamend Markt.jpg | wikidata=Q32999\n| content=To get to Vienna, you have three different railway options.

Night trains and quicker ''Euro-City'' trains arrive from virtually every city in Central Europe.

Sometimes you can buy both tickets before departure, otherwise see with the ticket agents if the conductor will be able to issue you with a domestic ticket once you cross the border to Austria.\n\n====From Germany====\nVienna has many direct railway connections to German cities. Some of them are:\n* [[Frankfurt]] - under 7 hours, a few times daily\n* [[Munich]] - under 4 hours, every two hours\n* [[Nuremberg]] - 4.5 hours, every two hours\n* [[Passau]] - 2.5 hours, every two hours\n\nThose cities are served by the Austrian ''Railjet'' or German ''Inter-City-Express'' (ICE) [[high-speed trains]]. Some of those services to Vienna also call at [[Cologne]], [[Duesseldorf]], [[Stuttgart]] or [[Wiesbaden]], as well as major stations in between, with lesser frequency than listed above. Even fewer services start as far out as [[Hamburg]], from where the ICE takes 9 hours to reach Vienna. The Railjet ''can'' accommodate bicycles, whereas the German ICE cannot.\n\nThe classic overnight train ''Metropol'' from [[Berlin]] was discontinued in December 2017, but returned as a [https://www.nightjet.com/ '''ÖBB Nightjet'''] train in December 2018, running via [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and [[Wroclaw]].\n\nThe Nightjet is offering [https://www.nightjet.com/dam/jcr:6a8041cb-0131-4ad3-84fd-25154548e5dd/nightjet-streckennetz.pdf two lines] from Vienna to Germany, Line ''NJ490'' is running from Vienna via Linz, Regensburg, Nuernberg and [[Hanover]] to [[Hamburg]], Line ''NJ40490'' is running from Vienna via Linz, [[Regensburg]], Nuernberg, [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to Duesseldorf.\n\n====From Czech Republic====\nThere are two companies operating trains between Prague (via Brno) to Vienna. Czech Railways (ČD) operate jointly with ÖBB a Railjet service every two hours with prices varying mostly between 15 and 30 € (bookable online or at a ČD ticket office). After cheap tickets are sold out at ČD, there may be some more at ÖBB. Another option is to take a private RegioJet train, which links Prague and Vienna four times a day for a similar price but with a different concept of on-board services. In the Czech Republic, railjet trains are abbreviated as ''rj'' and RegioJet as ''RJ'', Both ČD+ÖBB and RJ accept InterRail passes but they do not recognise each other's tickets.\n\nThe ÖBB also sell one-way 'SparSchiene' to Brno (€12), Ostrava (€14) and Prague (€29). Its cheaper to just get this to Brno and buy an onward domestic ticket to Prague (€5-10), and there is better availability than with the single Prague ticket.\n\nEURegio tickets are valid from Vienna to cities near to the border and tourist towns, including the return ticket with-in four days; [[Znojmo]] €15, [[Mikulov]] €18, [[České Budějovice]] (Budweis) €27 or [[Český Krumlov]] €27, and [[Plzeň]] €29 (children half-price, weekly and monthly tickets available).\n\n====From Hungary====\nFrom [[Budapest]] Keleti buy a discounted round-trip ticket, ''kirándulójegy'' (excursion or 4-day ticket) for €31. It includes the return within 4 days and is valid for all public transportation in Vienna for 2 days. So it's a deal even if you don't need a return ticket to Budapest. There are limited number of SparSchiene tickets each day for €13. All tickets are valid in all trains (including the high-speed RailJet). Trains confusingly depart Budapest East (Keleti pu), and stop at Hauptbanhof and Wien Meidling, from where they continue to Germany or Western Austria. Direct trains run every two hours or more. Otherwise transfer at Győr.\n\nTo Hungary the ÖBB offers tickets from €19 to Budapest and the EURegio ticket (Vienna to Hungary and return with 4 days); [[Mosonmagyaróvár]] €12, Győr €19, [[Tatabánya]] €25, [[Fertöszentmiklós]] €19, and [[Szombathely]] €22 (children half-price, weekly and monthly tickets available). The MÁV (Hungarian Railways) do not allow combined domestic tickets when crossing the border and you are risking a severe fine if caught by conductors.\n\n====From Slovakia====\nFrom [[Bratislava]] the cheapest ticket is €18 (return; children €9), or €23.38 including a one day public transportation ticket for all of Vienna (prices as of July 18, 2023). A one-way ticket is available to Rail-Plus cardholders for €10.\n\nTo Bratislava the ÖBB offers an EURegio ticket for €16 valid for return (in 4 days) and for travel on public transportation in Bratislava on the day of arrival. Its also free to take a bike along.\n\nA one-way ticket leaving from Vienna also costs €14 but doesn't include public transportation in Bratislava, so get the EURegio ticket and maybe you can give it to someone else who's headed for Vienna once you get to Bratislava.\n\n====From Eastern Europe====\nVia [[Slovakia]] or [[Hungary]].\n\nEach railway has an independent partnership with others, so tickets can be much cheaper to (or from) neighboring countries. A common type is the CityStar ticket that is valid for return and can be sold any station in the participating countries. [[Sopron]] in Hungary is near to Vienna (€14, hourly trains) for tickets on [http://www.mav.hu/ MÁV Hungarian Railways] at that train station (operated by the [https://www.gysev.hu/ Raaberbahn Railway]). [http://www.mav-start.hu/res/vasuti_menetdijtablazatok-09-12-13.pdf Hungarian prices]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}. [[Bratislava]] in Slovakia is another nearby alternative. Most tickets must be purchased 3 days in advance, possibly meaning an extra trip to the border to buy the ticket in advance.\n\n*'''Greece''': CityStar tickets are sold between anywhere in Greece and Hungary.\n*'''Bulgaria''': [http://www.bdz.bg/ BDZ] sell the return CityStar directly to Vienna (€88), a group of 3 will pay €59 each. Conversly you'll have to go to the Hungarian Railways if you want to go the other way.\n*'''Turkey''': Buy a ticket to the border at Kapikule (€5 from [[Istanbul]]), get a ticket from Bulgarian Railways.\n*'''Serbia''': [http://www.serbianrailways.com/ Serbian Railways] sell the so-called ''Wien Sepzial'' for €70 return from Belgrade, but a cheaper connection can be made through Budapest, buying the Budapest-Vienna portion in Hungary (€56 return).\n*'''Russia''': There are once weekly trains from [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], on Thursdays. More departures are often available during the summer season. '''[http://pass.rzd.ru/main-pass/public/en RZD]''' sells online tickets.\n*'''Ukraine''': There is a daily overnight train from [[Kyiv]] (22 hr).\n\n===By car===\n[[File:2012 Wien 0123 (7387020700).jpg|thumbnail|right|A parking garage in Erdbergstraße]]\nOnly one in two Viennese households has a car and fewer than 1/3 of the trips taken within the city are by car. However, since parking space is scarce in the inner districts and parking fees apply to all inner and include many outer districts too, it is usually a good idea for visitors to leave their car parked somewhere in the periphery and use the city's excellent subway &amp; tram system to get to the center. The '''[http://parkandride.at/ Park and Ride]''' is available at some subway stations in the city periphery for €3 per day. The weekly rates come with a discount if you add a subway/tram ticket.\n\nFor using the Austrian highway system, you will need a toll sticker (&quot;Autobahnvignette&quot;), which you can buy at gas stations and rest stops. There are stickers for 10 days, 2 months and 1 year. In Vienna, avoid the A23 Südosttangente at rush hour. Traffic jams are almost guaranteed there and throughout the city streets at rush hour.\n\n'''Parking''' anywhere within districts 1-10, 12, 14-17, 20, and in specially marked areas is restricted to 120 minutes (M-F, from 09:00 and 22:00) (12:00, 14:00-17:00, 09:00-19:00) and subject to a fee of €2.10 per hour unless you have a resident permit. The municipality provides detailed information on parking [http://www.wien.gv.at/english/transportation/parking/ on their website in English]. If you're unsure whether fees apply to the place you're in there's a free Android app that can help you. Payment is made by marking the time of arrival on a ticket (&quot;Parkschein&quot;), which can be bought at tobacco shops. If you have an Austrian cell number, you can pay by text or using [https://www.handyparken.at/ a smartphone app]. Commercial car parks (&quot;Parkhaus&quot;, &quot;Parkgarage&quot;) are available throughout the city, but these can be very expensive (for instance, €32 per day in the Parkgarage Freyung).\n\nParking-tickets are not available at machines. You can buy parking-tickets at following places:\n\n* Trafik (tobacco-stores)\n* Ticket-machines and ticket-shops in the metro-stations\n* Post offices\n* Gas-stations\n* Car-mobile clubs (ÖAMTC and ARBÖ)\n\n==== Park-and-Ride Places ====\nYou can find Park-and-Ride Places in Vienna at following stations of the U-Bahn (Vienna Metro) and S-Bahn (Suburban-Train Vienna):\n\n* {{rint|vienna|U1}} Leopoldau, Aderklaaer Straße, Neulaa, Oberlaa\n* {{rint|vienna|U2}} Donaustadtbrücke\n* {{rint|vienna|U3}} Ottakring, Erdberg\n* {{rint|vienna|U4}} Hütteldorf, Spittelau\n* {{rint|vienna|U6}} Siebenhirten, Perfektastraße, Spittelau\n* '''Suburban-Train:''' Wien-Hütteldorf (S45, S50, S80), Wien-Liesing (S2, S3, S4), Wien-Leopoldau (S1), Wien-Ottakring (S45)\n\n===By bus===\nThere is a slew of international bus services coming into Vienna daily. It is safe to assume that discounts are available (about 10% from Eurolines affiliates, about 15% on independent carriers) for those under 26 and over 60 on walk-up fares but not on discounted advanced purchase (&quot;promo&quot;) tickets.\n\nEurolines Austria, is the largest operator. Euroline's own vehicles have assured quality, but this is not the case of all of their international partners. Confusingly Eurolines Austria is doesn't always cooperate with an inbound Eurolines affiliate from another country, for instance there are two competing Eurolines services (Slovak and Austria) to Bratislava departing from separate stops. Always check the webpages of both the arrival and departure countries' Eurolines affiliated operator for the best price as well as checking for non-affiliated carriers.\n\nThere are two main bus stations in Vienna, and other locations where national and international services deposit passengers.\n*'''[https://www.vib-wien.at/en/vib-busterminal Vienna International Busterminal (VIB)]{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''' located adjacent to the subway stop Erdberg (U3) is overseen by the local Eurolines affiliate ''Blaguss'', who publish [http://www.eurolines.at/en/home/travel_with_eurolines/timetables/ timetables]{{Dead link|date=December 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}.\n*'''Waldmanngründe''' on the southwest corner of '''Südtiroler Platz'''(U1, S-Bahn) is a stop with an office only for services to Bratislava, other operators have offices in the nearby streets or just operate curbside services.\n*'''Praterstern''' on the (U1, U2 and S-Bahn) has two main bus stops, one in Lasallestraße for Tourbus services from the Czech Republic and one in Nordbahnstraße for Orangeways service to Hungary.\n* '''[https://www.flixbus.com/bus-schedule-bus-stop/vienna?wt_eid=2154110066800316018&amp;wt_t=1541100768671&amp;_ga=2.149470646.1071117394.1541100669-860094230.1541100669 Busstation Westbahnhof-Felberstraße/Europaplatz]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} Felberstraße''', 1150 Wien, stop of long distance-busses at the trainstation Westbahnhof.\n*'''[https://www.busterminal-vienna.at/en/ Busterminal Vienna/Stadioncenter]{{Dead link|date=April 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''' on the east (Address: Engerthstraße 242-244, 1020 Vienna, near the metro station U2 Stadion) is a stop of the yellow Student Agency coaches.\n*'''Vienna International Airport''' is served by nearly all buses to Bratislava, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, in addition to each bus line's city stop.\n\n====Austria====\nThere are few private domestic inter-city bus lines in Austria. Several regional services to Vienna operated by a mix of the federal government, the states of [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]], local governments and coach operators. Sometimes the cash-price for these is marginally lower than the train, otherwise the normal VOR public transport rates apply. They are most useful for traveling to the countryside, though timing and different departure locations in Vienna can make them attractive for inter-city travel in certain cases. All routes are operated with high-quality coaches and regional buses.\n\n* {{listing\n| name=Dr. Richard | url=http://www.richard.at/ | email=\n| address=Friedrichstraße 7 | lat= | long= | directions=Karlsplatz (across from the Secession Building) and other stops across Vienna\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=Graz €21.80 (€12 cheaper than by train)\n| content= Southern [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]] and [[Styria]].

Some may not be advertised and tickets are often not for sale at the ticket counter, rather from the bus driver or attendant. Ask around the bus stations, most of them leave in the afternoon. Buses from non-EU countries may be subject to higher scrutiny at the border. Sometimes operators smuggle or transport goods to supplement their low fares and the Hungarian border guards are not afraid to accept bribes from non-EU operators. You will likely never be asked to participate monetarily, although a bus driver may ask to put a carton of cigarettes above your seat or in your luggage. Legally, you're transporting &quot;your own&quot; one-carton cigarette allowance across the border, so you will not get in any trouble for that. It is also okay to decline cooperation.\n\nMost buses from [[Serbia]] go to VIB Erdberg (U3) whie most buses from [[Kosovo]] and [[Albania]] go to Südtiroler Platz (U1).

Get the idea the city and the railways have a tense history?\n* Wien '''Mitte''' – '''Landstraße'''\n* Wien '''Nord''' – '''Praterstern'''}}\n\n===Public transportation===\nVienna has a good [http://www.wien.gv.at/english/transportation-urbanplanning/public-transport/ public transportation system], which includes rail, commuter rail, underground, trams (trolleys), and buses. The underground is very efficient and will take you to within a few minutes walk of anywhere you are likely to want to visit. The subway alone has the second highest per-capita ridership in the world, and that is not accounting for the 27 tram lines, dozens of train lines or numerous buses.\n\nEnquiries for routes and timetables are possible with the mobile application ''WienMobil'', that is supplied by the public transport operator. The app is available for [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.wienerlinien.wienmobillab Android], [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1107918142 iOS] and can be accessed without installation [https://m.qando.at/wl_qando_mobileweb/monitorSelect on the internet].\n\n====Accessibility====\nThe entire U-Bahn system has step-free access, but entering the platform is only allowed with a valid ticket. Buses are all low-floor, with lifts for full wheelchair accessibility. The tram system runs a mixture of older high-floor and modern low-floor trams. At tram stops with digital displays, it is indicated whether the next tram arriving is step-free accessible. Wiener Linien generally schedules the trams so you won't have to let more than one go by before a low-floor one comes along.\n\nAll U-Bahn stations have textured pavement on the platform to assist blind patrons in recognizing the platform edge. '''Service dogs''' can be taken anywhere on the system, but if they are not officially registered as such with the Austrian government, they must be muzzled (As a practical matter, the transit authorities will pretty much never question whether an obvious service dog is registered, though). Ordinary dogs can be taken almost anywhere on public transit, but must either be in an enclosed carrier or leashed and muzzled.\n\nMore information about accessibility can be found [https://www.wienerlinien.at/eportal3/ep/channelView.do/pageTypeId/66533/channelId/-4001458 online.]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}\n\n====Fares====\n[[File:Wien Linie 02 20 Stubentor a.jpg|thumb|Vienna Ring Road with a tram]]\n[[File:Tram interior edit1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inside a vintage Viennese tram.]]\nPublic transportation within the city proper, including most everywhere you are likely to visit (the entire subway and tram network) is a single zone (Kernzone 100). Any transportation can be used: subway, any train – even high-speed ones – as long as you are traveling between two Vienna stations, trams, buses, night buses, and an interurban railway (the Wiener Lokalbahn) within the city limits.\n\nYou must validate (stamp) your ticket if the time and date is not printed on it, before entering the subway platform or train or as soon as you get on a bus or tram. You do not need to show your ticket to the bus or tram operator. Although there are not many spot checks, the fee for traveling without a ticket is €100.\n\nTickets are available at machines (Visa, MC accepted) and from counters at subway and rail stations as well as at tobacco shops (&quot;Tabaktrafik&quot;).

It is possible stamp the ticket multiple times for multiple people on a single day if traveling in a group. (For example, this ticket may be used by four people on two separate days, but four sections must be stamped each day.)\n\nChildren up to 14 do not need a ticket on Sundays, holidays and during Austrian school vacations. Children 15–23 are also exempt if they are enrolled in school in Austria.\n\nBicycles will be transported for free, but this is only permitted in the U-Bahn and from Monday to Friday only between 09:00 and 15:00, and after 18:30. On the weekends, you can take the bike on the U-Bahn 24 hours.\n\nIf you are staying for a few days and hope to do tons of sightseeing and/or shopping, the '''[https://www.viennacitycard.at/index.php?lang=EN Vienna Card]''' (''Wien Karte'') is a good deal. It costs €29 and is good for 72 hours of unlimited public transit within Vienna. The card also gets you discounts (typically €1 or €2 at the major museums and art galleries) to many attractions and shops. You can buy it at the airport, hotels, and underground stops. The Vienna Card allows one kid aged less than 15 to travel with the owner, possibly making it more attractive. One Vienna Card allows shop/museum rebates for the whole family.\n\nSee the [[Vienna International Airport]] for details on transfer to/from the airport.\n\n====Network====\nThe best rail (heavy rail and underground) [https://www.oebb.at/dam/jcr:cc6cd585-cb39-4fdd-9039-9c88ff53ab2d/liniennetz-ostregion.pdf transport map] is displayed at all ÖBB stations. There are so many lines that maps are normally very simplified, and there are no maps of the tram network. It can pay to ask or [http://www.wienerlinien.at/wl/ep/home.do?tabId=0 check]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} the best connection ahead of time. Major stations are well signed and connections are scheduled to match-up if service isn't frequent.\n\n====U-Bahn====\n[[File:Schnellverbindungen Wien.png|thumb|Rail lines inside Vienna (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Lokalbahn and local trains)]]\nThe five '''U-Bahn''' lines {{rint|vienna|U1}} {{rint|vienna|U2}} {{rint|vienna|U3}} {{rint|vienna|U4}} {{rint|vienna|U6}} are the most common way of getting around Vienna (the U5 line is under construction, and is expected to be completed by 2026). These underground, metro or subway lines have trains during the day every 1½–5 minutes and cover most of the important parts of the city and sights. The system is easy to understand; none of the lines branch or share track and the direction is indicated by the terminus station, so you'll need to glance at the map to see what those are. Most stations have digital displays on the platforms which tell you the wait time for the next train. On some lines, certain trains do not run all the way to the end, the platform display will tell you at which station the train is terminating. On Sunday nights, Saturday nights, and on the nights before public holidays in Austria, all lines are running also at night (all 15 minutes), you don't need a special ticket to use the nightline.\n\n====Tram====\n[[File:Netzplan Straßenbahn Wien.svg|thumb|450x450px|Vienna's tramway network]]\nTram (''Bim'', ''Straßenbahn'') lines have just a plain number or letter (''O'', ''1''). There are 27 lines which stop locally, useful for taking things a bit slower and seeing more of the city.\n\n[[File:Wien Linie 01 08 Schwedenplatz a.jpg|thumb|270px|Tramway in Vienna: public-transport-tram on the right side, ''Vienna-Ring-Tram'' (VRT) sightseeing-tour on the left side]]\nIn 2009 the yellow tourist [http://www.wienerlinien.at/eportal3/ep/channelView.do/pageTypeId/66533/channelId/-47394 Vienna Ring Tram]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} was established, which travels around the Ringstraße for €9 and has an audio guide in several languages. The famous 'ring lines' 1 and 2, however, will give you the exact same view (without, of course, the audio guide) and are covered by Vienna's normal fare zone. You can take tram 1 (bound for ''Prater-Hauptalle'') from ''Oper'' to ''Schwedenplatz'' and take tram 2 (bound for ''Ottakring'') from ''Schwedenplatz'' back to ''Oper''.\n\n====Bus====\nBus lines are denoted by a number that ends in a letter (i.e. ''3A'', ''80B''). You are unlikely to need to take a bus, but it is safe to assume if you see one that you can get on and it will take you to some higher form of transportation like the U-Bahn. Cheaper tickets (€1) are available for most 'B' buses; regular tickets and passes are also valid.\n\n====Rail====\nVienna's suburban rail network is often overlooked by tourists. It comprises three types of trains: '''S-Bahn''' (S), which mostly serve inner suburbs and stop at all stations with few exceptions, '''Regionalbahn''' (R), which are generally more long-distant than the S-Bahn and make limited stops on parallel S-Bahn routes, but otherwise all stops, and '''RegionalExpress''' (REX), which mostly serve the outermost suburbs and make very limited stops in the inner suburbs (although not all RegionalExpress trains are suburban trains). The network also stretches over the borders of the neighbouring countries.\n\nThe most important rail streches:\n*'''Stammstrecke''' (''Meidling''–''Hauptbahnhof'' (main station)–''Quartier Belvedere''–''Rennweg''–''Mitte''–''Praterstern''–''Floridsdorf'') trains run every 2–5 min. This is not a line itself but rather the result of the bunch of lines using the same stretch.\n*'''S45''' runs in the northwest of the city every 10–15 min along a beautiful railway built by architect Otto Wagner.\n\nRail trips to the suburbs of Vienna (in Vienna city all rail stations start with &quot;Wien&quot;) require an extra ticket. These are available as zones in VOR (Austria's Eastern Transit Region) or as point to point tickets from the railways. It is easiest to buy extra zones from the edge of the city. If you have a Vorteilscard a railway ticket will be cheaper; if you are planning to transfer to a bus the VOR-ticket is also valid for it, within the same zone.\n\n====Interurban====\nThe Wiener Lokalbahn (''WLB'') also referred to as the Badner Bahn is an interurban railway traveling from the Opera running as a tram on-street southwest through Vienna to Meidling station where it becomes a railway continuing onwards through the 23rd District and through suburbs and the rolling wine hills in [[Lower Austria]] to Baden. Within Vienna proper, it's covered by the same zone 100 ticket as the rest of the tram system, but you need an extra ticket to take it out into the suburbs.\n\n====Night Services====\n[[File:Nightline Wien.jpg|thumb|NightLine Vienna]]\nThe regular trams, trains and buses run until about 00:30 (just past midnight). Most of the commuter rail is shut between 01:00 and 04:00. On Friday, Saturday and on nights before holidays, the entire U-Bahn network runs all night. Additionally, a dense network of night buses, called &quot;NightLiners&quot; is available every night of the year. All Regular tickets are valid. Most buses terminate at &quot;Kärntner Ring, Oper&quot;, which allows for easy interchange. Intervals are 15 minutes (subway), 30 minutes (bus). Daytime service resumes at 05:00. The suburban-train lines S45 (Wien Handelskai - Wien Huetteldorf) and S2 between Wien Floridsdorf and Wien Liesing are also running on Friday nights, Saturday nights and on the nights before public holidays, the interval in 30 Minutes.\n\n===By taxi===\n[[File:Fiaker Wien.jpg|thumb|right|Fiaker coachmen waiting for customers]]\nMotor taxis are plentiful and can normally be hailed on the street or found at a taxi stand. Fares are set to a meter price, but if you prefer, you can always negotiate a fare. Always negotiate when traveling to the airport or outside of the city limits as fares are not set to those places.\n\nHorse-drawn taxis, considered a symbol of the city, are also available in the 1st district, although these are more expensive than the motor-taxis.\n\n===By car===\nAvoid driving a car within the central ring if possible. While cars are allowed on many of the streets there, the streets are narrow and mostly one-way. They can be confusing for a visitor and parking is extremely limited (and restricted during the day). Due to the comprehensiveness of the transit system, you most likely will not need a car within Vienna, except for excursions elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, it might be a good idea to leave your car at home during rush hours. Vienna's streets can become a little clogged in the mornings and early evenings and the drivers are not really known for being especially polite and friendly.\n\nPedestrians have the right of way in crossing all roads at a crosswalk where there is no pedestrian signal present. If there is such a pedestrian crossing on an otherwise straight section of the road, there will be a warning sign: you are required to yield to any pedestrian on this crossing. Austrians accustomed to experienced local drivers will step out with little thought and force you to stop, so slow down here and be careful. When driving in a neighborhood this &quot;right of way to pedestrians&quot; is an understood rule at every intersection, although pedestrians will be more careful before they step out. Again, be on the lookout for this: if you see a pedestrian waiting to cross, you should stop at the intersection for him or her.\n\n''Be careful when parking near tram tracks.'' Make sure the side of your car does not block the path of the tram. Otherwise the tram will be forced to stop and your car may be towed.\n\n===By bicycle===\n[[File:Trois trottinettes électriques Lime, Himmelpfortgasse, Vienne.jpg|thumb|alt=Lime|Lime]]\n[[File:ViennaBicycleStand.jpg|thumb|right|Bicycle stand pump at Siebensternplatz]]\n[[File:Citybike Wien.jpg|thumb|Citybike Wien]]\n[http://www.wien.gv.at/english/leisure/bike/index.htm Cycling]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }} is another option for travelling within Vienna, although it is still seen more as a leisure activity. Vienna's compact size makes cycling attractive. On a bicycle you can reach most places of interest within half an hour. There are many bicycle paths and lanes along major streets, in parks, and by the rivers. However, it can be complicated to cross town because the lanes follow illogical routes. One major complaint is that bicycle facilities were an afterthought and this is very apparent, many stop lights and intersections are dangerously or annoyingly set for bicyclists and paths are very illogical: they are sometimes on-street sometimes off, sometimes shared with pedestrians, sometimes not, and can vary or end out of nowhere. You are required by law to use a bike lane or path if there is one, unless it is blocked, otherwise regular traffic laws apply. Lights are required at night as are independently functioning brakes.\n\nPay attention to tram tracks in the street, and when crossing them, approach them from as close to perpendicular as possible, otherwise your tires can get caught in the groove next to the rail.\n\nIf your destination is in the outer suburbs, or you want to take a relaxed ride to the countryside, you may consider taking your bike on the U-Bahn (prohibited at rush hour, and always in buses and trams) or on a train. You need a ticket for your bike in trains. On the U-Bahn (metro) it is free to transport your bike on workdays from 09:00-15:00 and after 18:30 and for the whole day on weekends.\n\n* '''[http://www.citybikewien.at CityBike]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''' runs a short-term shared bike system all over the Vienna city. There are many stations in the inner districts and you can register to borrow a bike with your credit card (€1/to register) or obtain a Touristcard (€2.50/day). The first hour is free, the next €1, the third €2, etc. So always return your bike as soon as you have finished riding. 15 minutes after you return it, you can rent another or the same bike with a new free hour.  Foreign credit cards work fine in the machines - but you need one credit card per person.  You can't hire two bikes with one card.\n* '''[http://www.pedalpower.at/ Pedal Power]''' offers guided bicycle tours and bicycle rental. They deliver to hotels or you can pick them up at the Prater for a discount.\n\n===On foot===\n[[File:Graben Vienna Sept 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The busy shopping street ''Graben'' is a great starting point for a walk around Vienna]]\n\nWalking can also be very pleasant. The inner ring is quite compact with lots of pleasant cobblestoned and paved streets. It can be crossed in about 20 min.\n\nBring a comfortable pair of walking shoes as this is the most common way of getting around.\n\n==Talk==\nMost Viennese speak a range and mix of Viennese German and Standard German (&quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;) as their mother tongue, unlike in most other parts of Austria where the local dialect is still more prevalent. The Viennese German is counted amongst the Austria-Bavarian dialects. It used to be specifically split by districts. It also had many Yiddish influences (&quot;Hawara&quot;, &quot;Beisl&quot;). However, nowadays, basically everyone speaks Standard German as well, though the Austrian variety of German does differ in accent and somewhat in vocabulary (e.g. plastic bag is &quot;Plastiksackerl&quot;, not &quot;Plastiktüte&quot;) from Standard German as used in [[Germany]]. These differences are small enough that knowing Standard German is enough to get by.\n\nShould someone be so proud as to continue speaking in dialect and you don't understand, just ask the person to speak &quot;Hochdeutsch&quot; (standard German, literally &quot;high German&quot;) and he/she generally will. Standard German is the sole official language and thus the main recognized written language.\n\nPeople in jobs dealing with foreign visitors are usually fluent in English, though English is not as universally spoken as in northern European countries, and signs (including descriptive signs in museums) don't as often include English translations as in some other European countries, so those who don't speak German may find a traveler's phrase book or bilingual dictionary useful in some situations.\n\nApart from German and Austro-Bavarian, there are sizeable minorities in Vienna, such as Serbian, Croatian, Turkish and Romanian, who use their own languages amongst themselves and might be helpful if you speak any of their languages and come across a person of that origin.\n\n==See==\n[[File:Donauturm Nacht.jpg|thumb|right|Donauturm (Danube-Tower), viewing platform, restaurant and bar, open daily]]\nVienna has a rich history as the capital city of the monarchy, and thus, there is an abundance of historical buildings and museums.

The '''Ring Road''' (German: ''Ringstraße'') is a circular road surrounding the Innere Stadt district of Vienna and is one of its main sights. Its architecture is typical of the eclectic, historicist style called Ringstraßenstil (Ring Road Style) of the 1860s to 1890s. Built in the style of the Renaissance according to plans by Heinrich von Ferstel, the '''MAK- Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art''' is the first museum building on the ''Ringstraße''.

However, there is practically one on every corner. They are open generally M-F 07:00-19:00, Sa 07:90-18:00, later on Sunday and on public holidays, few stores are open: three in train stations (in Westbahnhof to 23:00, in Praterstern and Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof to 21:00), three at the airport (to 23:09) and one at the General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus, AKH).

Although many products are Austrian none of the chains are actually Austrian-owned. If you want to support the local economy more you can do so by frequenting independent shops or visiting actual markets.\n\n'''Upscale grocers''' are not common in Vienna.\n\n==Eat==\n{{eatpricerange|Below €10|€10-20|€20+}}\n[[Image:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|right|''Schnitzel'', a true Viennese mainstay]]\n\nViennese restaurant '''menus''' offer a bewildering variety of terms for dishes, most of which the visitor will never have heard of and many of which aren't in the brief lists of menu terms included in phrase books. However restaurants that have any foreign patrons at all usually have an English menu, though you may have to ask for it: the phrase &quot;English menu&quot; usually will be understood even by wait staff who don't speak English. A small bilingual dictionary will be useful for trying to decipher menu listings: at least it will enable you usually to determine what sort of food (chicken, beef, potato, etc.) is concerned, even if you can't tell how it's prepared. Not only savoury but also sweet main dishes are common in Austria.\n\nClassic Viennese dishes to try are the famous '''Wiener schnitzel''', a thin veal cutlet lightly breaded and fried, and the perhaps less well known '''Tafelspitz''', where a beef roast is simmered in a broth with root vegetables and herbs. Schnitzel made from pork (&quot;vom schwein&quot;, also called &quot;schnitzel Wiener art&quot;) is also popular. By law, restaurant menus are supposed to clarify if anything sold as &quot;Wiener schnitzel&quot; is made from something other than veal. As is common in much of eastern and central Europe, '''mushrooms''' are very popular, and when they're in season, you'll find a plethora of varieties on restaurant menus and for sale in markets, often for surprisingly low prices, at least if you're from North America. Chanterelles for €10/kg, anyone?\n\nViennese restaurant '''portions''' tend to be large. Many restaurants now include vegetarian options. Most restaurants have daily specials listed on a chalk board or sometimes on a printed insert in the regular menu. These are usually the best bet, though they may not be on the English menu, so you may have to ask to have them explained or try to translate them yourself.\n\n'''Bread''' in Viennese restaurants is usually charged as an extra; if there is a basket of it on the table, you'll usually be charged by the piece only if you take some.\n\nHotel '''breakfasts''' vary, but typically consist mainly of a buffet with a variety of rolls, cold cuts, and cheese. Fruit, yogurt, muesli, and often other types of cold cereal are also typically available. Many places will cook some eggs if you ask, or sometimes, especially for guests that are American or British, will offer to do so, but that's mainly seen as something for foreigners, cooked breakfasts not being typically Viennese, and you're unlikely to find any cooked food besides eggs on offer. Still, while the overall style may be &quot;continental,&quot; Viennese breakfasts are often considerably more substantial than many other parts of Europe.\n\nVienna being a fairly cosmopolitan city, there is a wide variety of international cuisine available. Italian, Greek, and Japanese food are particularly popular, although any international food you can name is represented.\n\n'''Tipping customs''' are similar to those in Europe and America though tips are slightly smaller; ten percent is usually sufficient in restaurants. Traditionally the way to tip a waiter is to mention the amount of the bill plus tip when you pay; for instance, if the bill is €15.50 you could give the waiter a €20 note and say &quot;siebzehn (seventeen),&quot; meaning he is to take out €15.50 for the bill, €1.50 for the tip, and so give you only €3 change. In this situation English numbers will usually be understood. Sometimes in less formal restaurants you can alternatively drop the tip into the money pouch the waiter usually carries.\n\n'''Credit cards''' aren't quite as commonly used in restaurants in Vienna as in Northern European countries, so ask if it's important to know beforehand.\n\nDon't expect &quot;service with a smile&quot; at a Viennese restaurant or cafe. While some servers are friendlier than others, most practice a level of reserved formality that can strike foreigners from more outgoing cultures as austere or even rude. It isn't intended that way, it's mainly a cultural expectation that service should be unobtrusive. So don't be offended if a server doesn't volunteer to discuss the specials or if they don't come to check on you while you're eating - the general expectation is if you want something, you'll get their attention and ask for it, otherwise they should leave you alone.\n\n[[File:Sandwiches Vienna.jpg|thumbnail|right|Viennese food offerings go far beyond ''Wienerschnitzel'' - here is a selection of seafood sandwiches]]\n===Street food===\nThe traditional Viennese fast food is '''sausage''' in all shapes and sizes. You can buy hot sausages and hot dogs at snack bars called &quot;Würstlstand&quot; all over the town. The famous Wiener Würstel is known as &quot;Frankfurter&quot; in Vienna, but many inhabitants prefer Bosna (with onions and curry), Burenwurst, and Käsekrainer or &quot;Eitrige&quot; (with melted cheese inside). A würstlstand will typically give a choice of sausages served as a &quot;hot dog&quot; (not a North American hot dog, it just means any kind of sausage served in a bun) or &quot;mit Brot&quot; (&quot;with bread,&quot; i.e. cut into bite size chunks and served with a small disposable fork, with a roll on the side). You typically get a choice of mustard or ketchup and (rarely) other condiments, which the server will put on for you.\n\n'''Roast chestnuts''' (&quot;Maroni&quot;) are a common snack during the colder months, and are sold from street stalls all over the city, especially near train and U-Bahn stations, and at Christmas markets.\n\nIn addition to this, the '''local snack culture''' also includes more ex-Yugoslavian and Turkish varieties of fast food, such as the Döner Kebap, sandwiches of Greek and Turkish origin with roasted meat, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and yogurt and/or hot sauce. Places that sell kebap often sell takeaway slices of pizza too. Good '''kebaps''' can be bought at the Naschmarkt. The lower end of the Naschmarkt (further away from Karlsplatz or city centre) is cheaper than the upper end (closer to Karlsplatz), and the right lane (facing away from the city centre) is reserved for mostly sit-down eateries. Another good place to find snacks (especially while going out) is Schwedenplatz.\n\nBy far the cheapest way to get a fast food meal in Austria (and probably the only meal available for just over €1) is buying an Austrian sandwich (sliced brown bread + ham/cheese + gherkin) from a supermarket. Supermarkets with a deli counter (Feinkostabteilung) will prepare sandwiches to take away at no extra charge. You only pay for the ingredients. There is usually a large selection of meat products, cheese, and bread rolls available here, too. You point at the combination you want, can also mention the max total you can pay, and then pay at the cash register. One of the favorites is the &quot;Leberkäsesemmel&quot;, which is lightly spiced, very finely ground meat baked in a pan, sliced, and served on a roll. If you know a bit of German, you'll note that &quot;Leberkäse&quot; literally translates to &quot;liver cheese,&quot; but it contains no cheese and the Viennese version contains no liver. Freshness and quality at the grocery stores are normally better than at a sandwich stand on the street.\n\nAnother great way to eat on a budget is at one of Vienna's hundreds of bakeries. They sell anything from cinnamon rolls to pizza for a good price. It's also a great breakfast-on-the-run alternative because they also have coffee/espresso to go. However, most places do have a couple of tables and chairs where you can enjoy your food.\n\n==Drink==\n===Cafés===\n[[File:Cafe central wien vienna philipp von ostau.jpg|thumb|Café Central]]\nVienna's ''Kaffeehäuser'' (coffee houses) are world famous for their grandness and the lively coffee house culture. Skipping the ''Kaffeehauskultur'' is missing out a big part of Viennese culture. You should at least visit one of the countless traditional baroque 19th- or funky 20th-century coffee houses where you can sit down, relax, and enjoy refreshments.\n\nMost cafés also serve beer, wine and liqueurs. Many serve meals, especially at lunch, and these are often cheaper than in restaurants. Most have a fine selection of ''Torten'' (tortes or cakes), some offer other baked goods. In general some are more restaurant-like, some more café-like and some more bar-like.\n\n====Coffee====\n{{infobox|&quot;Entschuldigen Sie Frau/Herr Ober!&quot;|Although the head waitress/waiter (''Ober'') of most cafés is not nearly as snooty as they might let on, there are some '''definite don'ts''':\n*Don't ask for coffee to go. International chains and many bakeries offer it if you really need it.\n*Don't just order &quot;coffee&quot; - that's like going into a restaurant and ordering just &quot;food&quot;. Find a type that suits your taste.\n*Don't expect your waitress/waiter to just bring you the bill - you are supposed to ask for it when you are finished and ready to go. It is considered impolite for them to rush you by bringing it on their own.\n*Don't forget to tip when you pay. Just round up about 10%. Say explicitly how much you wish to pay (e.g., €3.50 for a €3.20 coffee) when handing the money the waitress/waiter.\nRemember: cafés are a very slow-paced environment, approach them as you would a sit-down restaurant, bring a book or some friends, or make use of the newspapers on hand and enjoy your hours relaxing there!\n}}\n\nCoffee is obviously an important part of the coffeehouse culture. Vienna was not only the center of the Austrian Empire but also the center of a much larger coffee empire, and the local roasts were sold across Europe. Today many people are still familiar with the term ''Vienna roast''.\n\nVienna prides itself in its dozens of varieties of different coffees, although the Italian style and names are better known by many youth than the Viennese, the cafés are keeping the traditions alive. Most commonly:\n*'''Kleiner Schwarzer''' also known simply as a '''Schwarzer''' or as a '''Mokka''' is the Viennese version of espresso. It is made with a tick more water, a Viennese roast (the point between origin and roast flavor) and it is pulled slowly allowing it to oxidize.\n*'''Großer Schwarzer''' is a double Schwarzer (similar to a double espresso).\n*'''Kleiner Brauner''' is a mokka (espresso) with cream, often on the side.\n*'''Großer Brauner''' is a double Mokka with cream.\n*'''Melange''' is perhaps the most typical Viennese coffee. Similar to cappuccino but with the Viennese style mokka and more foamy milk in equal parts.\n*'''Verlängerter''' is mokka (espresso) with extra hot water, similar to a small Americano.\n*'''Kapuziner''' is a mokka (espresso) with a dollop of whipped cream on top.\n*'''Kaffee Verkehrt''' (or in the more modern places '''Kaffee Latte''') is the local version of a latte.\n\n[[File:Wien Café Sperl Zeitungen.jpg|thumb|Vienna Café newspapers]]\nAlso consider specialties like the ''Kaisermelange'' (coffee, milk, egg yolk and cognac) on the menu. Most cafés have a house specialty (for instance, &quot;Kaffee Central&quot; at Café Central). Many coffee houses have a huge selection of international newspapers.\n\n====Coffee houses====\n'''Finding a café''' is not hard in Vienna; Finding a particular café you are looking for is another story. Most of the baroque &quot;top&quot; coffee houses are on the Ring and main streets of the [[Vienna/Innere Stadt|Innere Stadt]], mostly cozier and often less formal 1970s or 80s modern-style coffee houses are hidden away on the [[Vienna/Innere Stadt|Innere Stadt]]'s backstreets, and distributed across the rest of the city ([[Vienna/Wieden#Drink|4th district]], [[Vienna/Neubau#Drink|7th district]], [[Vienna/Josefstadt#Drink|8th district]], [[Vienna/Outer West#Drink|Outer West districts]], ..).\n\n[[File:Sachertorte DSC03027.JPG|thumb|right|The original ''Sachertorte'' at Cafe Sacher (see [[#Sleep|Hotel Sacher]])]]\n\n=====Chains=====\n* {{drink\n| name=Oberlaa | url=http://www.oberlaa-wien.at/ | email=\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=Melange €3.70; Slice of Torte €3.50\n| content=Very Viennese cafes, really delicious bakery and well known confectionery.

Many cafés across Vienna and Lower Austria. Their menus have a very useful graphical design indicating the precise ingredients and proportions in each type of coffee, so it's worth visiting if you are a complete beginner.\n}}\n\n===Water===\nRather unusually it is necessary to say some words about Vienna's drinking water.\n\nThe majority of Vienna's water comes from the three &quot;Hochquellwasserleitungen.&quot; Meaning &quot;high-(as in mountain) spring waterlines (as in aqueducts). Indeed the city's water flows through aqueducts from the mountains around 100 km south of Vienna (Schneeberg and Hochschwab). These were built during the reign of Emperor Franz Josef and supply Vienna with unchlorinated high-quality drinking water, with a considerably higher quality than many bottled waters.\n\nSo if you visit this city, it is not necessary to buy water. You can simply drink tap water here unless you prefer sparkling water.\n\nAnother speciality is that at typical coffeehouses a coffee is often accompanied by a glass of cold clear water. In most restaurants, you can get a glass of drinking water for free with any order, just specify tap water (&quot;Leitungswasser&quot;).\n\n===Wine===\nNew wine is usually enjoyed at a ''Heurigen'' (family-run vineyard bars allowed to the new vintage). Austria in general, but especially the area around Vienna, produces quite a large amount of wine each year. There are even many vineyards within the city in Döbling (19th District). The wine is not often exported and white is more common than red. Grüner Veltliner is a common tart and fresh white wine served almost everywhere. Officially the new wine season begins on November 11 (St Martin's Day), but as early as September, some partially-fermented new wine (called ''Sturm'' which is cloudy, because it has not been strained) is available around town at stands and in 2L green bottles (try the '''Naschmarkt''' – sometimes the vendors will have samples of this drink, which at about 4% alcohol is less strong than wine). Taverns can call themselves Heurigens whether the wine they serve is their own or not – for genuine in-house product look for a ''Buschenschank''. This is a particularly Viennese Heuriger which can only be open 300 days per year or until their supply of house-made wine runs out. Heurigen can be found e.g. in Grinzing, Sievering (19th district) and Mauer &amp; Rodaun (23rd district) areas, but also in almost every suburban area in Vienna. Even in the center, there are some ''Stadtheurigen''. While the Heurigen of Grinzing are bigger and more famous with tourists, they are often a rip-off. If any of the year’s vintage lasts until next year, it officially becomes ''Alte'' (old) wine on the next Saint Martin's Day.\nThe Heurigen in the South of Vienna or in [[Perchtoldsdorf]] are much cheaper and serve the same quality as the Heurigen in Grinzing. Also in the Northern suburbs, you can find cheap and somewhat authentic Heurigen. Try the areas of [[Stammersdorf]] or [[Hagenbrunn]], for example [http://www.matzka.at.tt/ Karl Matzka], hard to reach by public transport.\n\nAfter a long day, the perfect place to relax among Viennese are the Heurigen in the suburbs. Somewhat akin to a beer garden, except with wine, these tiny treasures are the only places authorized to serve new wine. New wine is made from the first pressing of the grape and can appear a little cloudy. Be careful, it's stronger than you might think! This is why it's served in very small glasses, 0.25L and up. Some Heurigen serve food, either elaborate Viennese specialties or very simple bread and cheese platters. No matter which one you choose, you're guaranteed to enjoy yourself. Just hop on a convenient outbound tram line, take it to the very last stop, and look for buildings with large, evergreen foliage hung over the doors. Each one is unique, but all are a good bargain. Locals invariably have a favorite: ask around.\n\n'''Glühwein''' is hot, sweetened red wine with cinnamon and cloves, served from stalls at Christmas markets. Some markets have a peculiar system where you'll be asked for a deposit on the mug the wine is served in, and when you're finished, you can return it to any glühwein vendor at that market to get your deposit back - payments are worked out among themselves through some mysterious process.\n\n===Wine bars===\n* {{drink\n| name=Wein &amp; Co | url=http://www.weinco.at/ | email=\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone=+43 1 743 42 00-34 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| content=A chain shop for wine lovers featuring a wine bar in every location.

There are diverse cafés, bars, clubs, parties and festivals as well as thriving nocturnal scenes.\n\n====Cafés and bars====\nThe café scene often continues into the early hours, during the week and on weekends. Additionally there are many traditional neighborhood bars some which also have Viennese food. Most popular though, are bars (some with a nominal cover fee) with a DJ and small dance floor. These are quite comfortable and there are plenty to meet anyones musical taste, many are open all night.\n\n====Mainstream====\nAlthough &quot;mainstream&quot; is hardly a majority of people in Vienna it is still referred to as such. Even here there is quite a bit of variance between places the conservative working class goes out and the conservative upper class tends to go.\n\n* '''Gürtel at Nussdorfer Straße''' (U6) has a few mid-size cheap clubs like '''[http://www.locobar.at/ Loco]''' and '''[http://www.rideclub.at/ Ride Club]{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot }}''' around. They all have very cheap booze and cover if you arrive early.\n\n====Alternative====\n\n====Queer====\nAlthough gay nightlife in Vienna is not concentrated in one area, it's blossoming. It can be difficult to keep up with what's on offer, but luckily Vienna is fairly accepting and you can go out and meet other gay people in most venues.

There are male and female prostitutes, many from Austria's neighboring countries (few from Austria), but also from Africa, Latin America and Asia offering their services. Brothels differ greatly from small to the point one-room operations to hokey grand parlors. There is no true red-light district, but there are many 'bars' located on the 'Gürtel' as well as in the 2nd District, but they can be found everywhere. Street prostitution areas exist but should be avoided due to the lack of regulation and high number of trafficked and unregistered workers. There are plenty of go-go clubs as well, though, that are not brothels. Some of these have male and female dancers dancing together and are frequented by men and women together.\n\n[[File:InterContinental Wien Lobby.JPG|thumbnail|Viennese hotels provide an endless supply of &quot;revival&quot; furniture, wood panelling, gilded chandeliers and patterned carpeting]]\n\n==Sleep==\n&lt;!--Please do not list hotels/hostels here, place it in the correct [[Vienna#Districts]] --&gt;\nVienna is a major tourist hotspot and offers a complete range of accommodation options. Prices are relatively higher than in neighboring countries, or even in the rest of Austria. Many of the Viennese hotels, hostels and pensions, especially its centre, are housed in historic buildings dating from before the Second World War, most from the 19th-century ''Gründerzeit''. This means that many of them offer relatively small rooms with sometimes compromised views, and rooms within the same property can vary widely, even at the same price.\n\nYou will probably find that Viennese hotels usually offer very traditional decor, bathrooms with bathtubs and, again, relatively space-limited quarters. There are very few &quot;modern design&quot; hotels, and those looking for American-style over 30m² rooms should do good research before booking and make sure their booked room matches the expectations. On balance, breakfasts in Vienna are usually relatively good, with a good variety of products, even at the less pricey establishments. Moreover, you can count on many local cafes to offer you breakfast should your booking not include one. A typical Viennese hotel breakfast is buffet-style and fairly substantial, and consists of bread and rolls (usually very good quality), a variety of cold cuts, and fruit, as well as muesli and other cold cereals, and juice and coffee.\n\n[[File:Sofitel Wien 2.jpg|thumb|''Le Loft'' at the Sofitel is one of the few hotel restaurants with a view over Vienna - and an otherworldly ambiance afforded by its painted and lit ceiling]]\nIn '''choosing an accommodation''' it is important to know which part of the city you want to spend time in. Most accommodations claim to be centrally located, which for the Viennese would mean they should be in or next to the 1st District, few actually are. Many are even outside the core districts 2-9. Still, from the ones located within a 5-minute walk of an underground or at least a rail or tram station, you should be able to get to the center within 20 minutes or less on public transportation.\n\n'''Smoking''' rooms are relatively common. '''Non-smoking''' rooms are in limited supply, and hotels with non-smoking floors are less common. Sensitive non-smokers may be bothered that public areas of the hotel, including the hallways, are often heavy with tobacco smoke.\n\nDuring summer there can be several days where the temperature is over 30°C. There are very few hotels that have air conditioning. People who are used to sleeping in a cool environment should seek out hotels that have air conditioning or schedule their trips during those times of the year when the temperature will be cooler.\n\n==Connect==\nAs of Sept 2021, Vienna has 5G from all Austrian carriers.\n===Internet===\n[[File:Wien Museumsquartier HDR.jpg|thumbnail|right|MuseumsQuartier has free internet, lots of outdoor seating - and quite a few world-class museums to boot!]]\nVienna has a large number of mostly free wireless hotspots in bars, restaurants, and cafés (see drink section). Wifi is known locally as ''WLAN'' or ''Wireless LAN''. Those that are on the [http://www.freewave.at Freewave Wi-Fi network] can be found [http://www.freewave.at/en/hotspots here]. MuseumsQuartier has free wireless internet. There are plenty of internet cafes except for in the first district. Touchscreen media terminals are available (including internet) in many phone booths, much of the content about Vienna is free.\n\nIf you plan to visit also places outside the city and you don't want to stay without internet it's recommended to buy a prepaid 3G-simcard (all providers offers fast 3G service, also in rural and remote areas of Austria) and put it in your smartphone or internet USB stick. Download is mostly around 5-6 Mbit/sec and upload 2-3 Mbit. (for HSDPA). The monthly cost for mobile internet is between €4 (1GB) and €15  (unlimited) (August 2011). The best 3G coverage in rural areas is from A1 [https://www.a1.net/ A1].

There are no slums or districts you should avoid. In general, you can visit any part of the city at any time of the day without taking many risks — just use your common sense. The Prater (fair grounds/amusement park area) is said by some locals to be less safe at night, though more in reference to pickpockets than anything else. The Praterstern railway station is a magnet for drunks, homeless people and drug addicts, but they generally do not bother passers-by. As a general rule of thumb, its best to avoid train stations, parks (especially Reumannplatz) and some larger subway stations at night, but even then, nothing bad should happen to you.\n\nAs in any major city, watch out for '''pickpockets''' who grab and run when boarding the U-Bahn. Petty crimes (like jackets 'going missing') are more common and normally go unreported and won't get much sympathy. There have been a very few '''racist assaults''' in Vienna (even some by the police themselves). One runs the risk of being pickpocketed. Schwedenplatz, along the Ring, is sleazy in the evenings, but basically harmless; the Stadtpark, along the Ring, to the East, is a bit deserted at night and therefore best avoided.\n\n'''Prostitution''' is legal, even on the street, and is common around the area of the Prater. Ironically, some of the areas are a stone's thrown from the UNODC Headquarters (the UN agency responsible for combating human trafficking) and are human trafficking hubs for all of Europe. Many of these prostitutes are not registered and a high number are known to be trafficked, so take care if seeking their services. It is safer for everyone involved to visit a brothel. Women dressed in a certain manner walking around these areas alone at night might feel uncomfortable being checked-out in a certain way but there is no real danger. (There is no male street-prostitution to speak of in Vienna.)\n[[File:Opera Toilet Vienna Opernpassage.jpg|thumbnail|right|Vienna has it all - and more! Even a musical toilet in the passage under the Opera (singing during usage not compulsory)]]\n\nThere have been some reports of '''fraud''' around Karlsplatz and the Ring. The usual scenario is that someone will stop you and ask for directions. A couple of other guys show up claiming to be police, showing a badge (must be fake). They ask if you were getting drugs from the other guy and then will ask for your passport and wallet for verification. When you are busy trying to convince them that your passport is valid, one of them sneaks out some money from your wallet. Best to tell them that you want to go to the police station — there is one at Karlsplatz U-Bahnstation. It's a minor annoyance, but it's better to be careful. In a different case of fraud they try to convince you that your money is counterfeit money and that they have to inspect it. As always use common sense: police are taught to approach you in a very distinctive way (you will notice if they do so), the badge must have ''Polizei'' ([ˌpɔlɪˈʦaɪ̯] police) and the Austrian coat of arms and/or the Austrian flag located somewhere on it, and they will be willing to bring you to the police station or a properly uniformed officer.\n\nViennese police officers are virtually always honest and polite, and will do their best to assist you if you need them, although many of them, mostly older officers, have limited to non-existent English skills. If you need to report a serious crime and don't speak German, they will usually manage to round up an English-speaking officer.\n\nDo not walk on the '''bike lanes''' and cross them like you would cross any other road. Some bike lanes are hard to recognize (e.g. on the &quot;Ring&quot; in Vienna) and some cyclists bike rather fast. Walking on bike lines is not only considered impolite but it is illegal and you run the danger of getting hit.\n\nPay attention to the '''tram tracks''' in Vienna. Unlike other cities, Viennese trams move '''very''' '''fast''' and can easily kill you if they hit you. The modern Viennese trams are hard to hear as well. If you encounter tram tracks and you must cross the road, make sure to look both ways before crossing. If you park near tram tracks and you have to get off on the same side as the street, make sure to look both ways as well.\n\nIf you see people '''gambling''' on the streets (usually in popular tourists' destinations like Stephansplatz or Mariahilfer Straße), stay away! The modus operandi usually involves a guy playing the classic game of &quot;hiding the ball&quot;. This involves covering the ball (or small trinket) with either a bottle cap or a match box and swirling it around with two other bottle caps asking people to guess the position of the ball. The game is set in a way that you can easily see the ball's position. This is done to lure the unsuspecting person into placing a wager. There are usually two main players and, between them, they will lose and win money back and forth to give the appearance that it is a fair game - do not be tricked! They are from the same gang. Once you get greedy and get lured in, you will surely lose your money! The person in control of the bottle caps will remove the ball from their position through sleight of hand and you will never see your money back. Besides the two or three other players involved, there are usually at least two lookouts - one on each side of 'stage'. Vienna has plenty of legal casinos if you care to try your luck.\n\n[[File:Französische Botschaft Wien.jpg|thumbnail|right|The French Embassy to Austria in Vienna]]\nIn crowded areas such as train stations or the city center, it is not uncommon be approached by beggars. Some sell &quot;[https://augustin.or.at/ Augustin]&quot;, a homeless' magazine for critical journalism and social work. If they wear a badge, they are reputable: They received training and are obligated to follow social norms; they do not try to trick you, and can be fun to talk to. However, if they do not have a badge or insist on handing you something (such as a rose or a magazine), dismiss them by walking away and/or shaking your head and saying &quot;Nein danke&quot; ([naɪ̯n ˈdaŋkə] no thank you). Their typical ruse is to give you something and then demand payment for it. Similarly, it is best to ignore people asking for money for train tickets or the like. They can be obtrusive, but never violent.\n\n==Cope==\n===Laundry===\n* {{listing\n| name=Green &amp; Clean| url=https://www.greenandclean.store/ | email=\n| address=Landgutgasse 25| lat=48.1812 | long=16.3741 | directions=300m south of Wien Hbf\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours=06:00-22:00 daily | price=From €16 to wash &amp; dry 8kg\n| content=This large chain of self-service laundries is a good way to avoid extortionate per-piece hotel laundry charges.

right. All of the following places are within the metropolitan area and reachable on an all-zone Vienna travelcard (and yes, this also applies to Sopron).\n\n* [[Krems]], a smaller and historic town at the entrance of the [[Wachau]] valley about 80&amp;nbsp;km east of Vienna. Reachable by rail from Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof, Wien Spittelau (U4, U6) and Wien Heiligenstadt (U4) with suburban trains to &quot;Krems/Donau&quot;. There are hourly connections and the travel time is about one hour. Krems is relatively small, so you can walk there or rent a bike.\n* [[Baden (Austria)|Baden bei Wien]], is a smaller historic town 25 km south of Vienna. Famous for its bathes and thermal waters. It features many beautiful buildings and parks from the Biedermeier period. There is a direct tram line going from the Vienna Opera to Baden otherwise faster trains are available too.\n* [[St. Pölten]], the capital of [[Lower Austria]], hosts many sights. One is the Dom zu St. Pölten, a baroque church which until 1722 served as a Roman basilica cathedral. The St. Pöltner Rathaus (city hall) and the Pottenbrunn Castle (which can only be seen from the outside) are also worth a visit. St. Pölten is accessible by an hourly suburban rail service from Westbahnhof station (''U-Bahn U3'') which takes 80 minutes to St. Pölten (''passengers for Pottenbrunn Castle should get off at Pottenbrunn, one stop before St. Pölten''). Total travel time from the city centre is 100 min.\n* [[Wiener Neustadt]] also has a lot to offer for tourists: the cathedral, renovated in 1975-1999, the castle and the city museum to name a few. The city is reachable by suburban train from Wien Mitte station on the S-Bahn S6 (via Ebenfurth) and S9 (via Baden) routes, and the travel time is 75-80 min.\n* [[Eisenstadt]], the capital of [[Burgenland]], hosts several large churches as well as the Esterházy castle which offers a wine cellar, gift shop, guided tours, and concerts in the famous Haydnsaal as well as the large garden on the back. There are two suburban rail connections: the direct service Hauptbahnhof - Eisenstadt - Wulkaprodersdorf - (Wiener Neustadt) which takes 67 min to Eisenstadt, and the Deutschkreutz-bound service from Meidling to Wulkaprodersdorf + connecting service on the Hauptbahnhof route (opposite direction, towards Hauptbahnhof) to Eisenstadt, which takes 1 hour from Meidling and is thus slightly faster. However, from the city centre both routes take 80 minutes so you might as well go with the direct service from Hauptbahnhof.\n* [[Sopron]], a historic town in [[Hungary]] which is also reachable by suburban rail: from Wien Meidling (''U-Bahn U1 to Südtiroler Platz and suburban train to Meidling'') the hourly service to Deutschkreutz takes you to Sopron in 70 min. Total travel time from the city centre is 90 minutes.\n\n===Capitals or other places===\n\n* [[Salzburg]] is the fourth largest city in Austria. Its &quot;Old Town&quot;, with its world famous baroque architecture, is one of the best-preserved city centers in the German-speaking world and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. There are direct trains from Vienna taking 2½ hours.\n* [[Graz]] is the second-largest city in Austria. The City of Graz including its historic centre and Schloss Eggenberg is a world heritage site. There are direct trains from Vienna taking 2½ hours.\n* [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]], is 55&amp;nbsp;km from Vienna and reachable by two suburban rail routes: one runs to Hlavna stanica via eastern Vienna and the other one to Petrzalka via the southeast. The latter takes 57 minutes and the former 71 minutes. Both lines originate at Hauptbahnhof station (''U-Bahn U1 to Hauptbahnhof / Südtiroler Platz or suburban train to Hauptbahnhof''). ''However, depending on your point of origin, taking U-Bahn U2 to Stadlau or U3 to Simmering and suburban train from either to Hlavna stanica may be faster than travelling via Hauptbahnhof''. Travel time from the city centre via Hauptbahnhof (to Petrzalka) or Stadlau (to Hlavna stanica) is 75 min. You may also consider making the journey by ferry: The [https://twincityliner.com/en Twin City Liner] makes the journey through the Danube. It takes about 75 minutes and costs €20.\n* [[Brno]], a city of around 400,000 people in the [[Czech Republic]] with close historical links with Vienna, is 1½ hours from Vienna by fast train.\n* [[Prague]], the capital of the [[Czech Republic]], is a very well preserved medieval city. The city's historic buildings and narrow, winding streets are testament to its centuries-old role as capital of the historic region of Bohemia.\n* [[Innsbruck]], regional capital of [[Tyrol]] and largest city in the [[Alps]].\n* [[Budapest]], the capital city of [[Hungary]], is a beautiful city located on the banks of the [[Danube]]. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its cultural and architectural significance.\n* [[Slovenia]], a small but very beautiful country which offers a lot of tourist attractions (2012 European capital of Culture [[Maribor]], charming [[Ljubljana]], [[Julian Alps]], gorges &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Tolmin]], [[Vintgar]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, caves &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Postojna]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, coast &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Piran]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and amazingly beautiful [[Bled]] lake)\n\n\n\n\n\n{{routebox\n| image1=A1-AT.svg\n| imagesize1=22\n| directionl1=W\n| majorl1=[[Melk]]\n| minorl1=[[St. Pölten]]\n| directionr1=E\n| majorr1=END\n| minorr1=\n\n| image2=A2-AT.svg\n| imagesize2=22\n| directionl2=N\n| majorl2=Becomes [[File:S1-AT.svg|14px]]\n| minorl2=becomes [[File:A23-AT.svg|20px]]\n| directionr2=S\n| majorr2=[[Wiener Neustadt]]\n| minorr2=[[Baden (Austria)|Baden]]\n\n| image3=A4-AT.svg\n| imagesize3=22\n| directionl3=W\n| majorl3=END\n| minorl3=\n| directionr3=E\n| majorr3=[[Neusiedl am See]]\n| minorr3=[[Vienna International Airport]]\n\n| image4=B14-AT.svg\n| imagesize4=22\n| directionl4=N\n| majorl4=[[Tulln]]\n| minorl4=[[Klosterneuburg]]\n| directionr4=S\n| majorr4=END\n| minorr4=\n}}\n\n{{isPartOf|Austria}}\n{{guidecity}}\n{{geo|48.208|16.373|zoom=11}}\n{{related|UNESCO World Heritage List}}</text>\n<sha1>4twyrhd7yi9h93vjy2jbh7flmakm6k8</sha1>\n</revision>\n</page>\n"

    '''Vienna''' is a largely residential city of 17,000 people (2018) in
    [[Virginia]], not far from [[Washington, D.C.]]. It has a downtown with many
    small businesses, and a portion of the Washington &amp; Old Dominion
    Railroad Regional Park hiking and biking trail cuts through the center of
    the town.


    ==Get in==


    '''The car is king in Vienna.''' It's the most practical way to get around
    in most of Northern Virginia, due to a very basic mass transit system, and
    sprawl. Sprawl and lacking mass transit of course lead to traffic; the D.C.
    metro area has the second worst in the United States by some measures. But
    feel free to drive to and through Vienna, just not M-F 8AM to 10AM or 4:30
    to 7PM.


    Vienna does have a Washington Metro stop, at the end of the Orange line;
    however, it is almost two miles from the center of town. Buses run the
    length of the town up and down Maple Avenue, the defacto main street.


    &quot;Downtown&quot; Vienna is small enough to get around on a bike or on
    foot, but it's a car that will get you in and out of the town.

    [[Vienna]]'s '''Inner East''' is an artificial island formed between the
    river and the ''Donaukanal''. The island contains large expanses of parks
    and forests, including the famous ''Prater'' park with the permanent funfair
    including the ''Riesenrad'' ferris wheel. As most of the island was only
    reclaimed in the late 19th century, there is much modern architecture to be
    found in this area as well. Administratively, the island is divided into the
    districts of Leopoldstadt (2) and Brigittenau (20).


    ==Understand==

    '''Leopoldstadt''' (2) is the southern half of the island that is formed
    between the Danube and the Danube Canal. It stretches from the more wild
    forests of the '''Prater''' in the south up through the point where the
    Prater becomes a more formal park and amusement park where the
    transportation hub '''Praterstern''' is located. Going onward to the north
    are several neighborhoods from the [[w:Gründerzeit|Gründerzeit]] with dense
    housing including impressive Neo-Baroque buildings. Towards the north of the
    district along the Danube Canal across from Schwedenplatz is the
    '''Karmeliterviertel''' (Karmeliter Quarter) which was once a Jewish ghetto
    and today is the hub of Jewish life in Vienna. This area is indeed quite
    diverse across the board and is becoming gentrified. At the edge of that
    area is the '''Augarten'''. The area past that has been hand-picked for an
    intense development project that will turn several former freight yards into
    entire new neighborhoods. Along the Danube are numerous massive housing
    projects from the 1920s onward.


    '''Brigittenau''' (20) is the northern half of the island between the Danube
    and the Danube canal. It consists mostly of land gained by the regulation of
    the Danube in 1870-75. Hence it does not contain any distinctive historical
    areas.


    ==Get in==

    [[File:13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-115.jpg|thumb|right|The Praterstern seen from
    the Prater Riesenrad]]

    The main train station of the area is the
    {{Marker|type=go|name=Praterstern|lat=48.2182|long=16.3919|image=Praterstern
    16 .jpg}}, the ultra-modern multi-modal station opened in the new
    millennium, where bus, tram, U-Bahn, S-Bahn and long-distance train lines
    converge at a namesake intersection, from which the district's main streets
    project in a star-like fashion. You can reach it directly from [[Vienna
    International Airport]] with the S7 S-Bahn. Both U-Bahn lines serving the
    district, {{rint|vienna|U1}} and {{rint|vienna|U2}}, stop at the
    Praterstern, and pretty much all tram lines have a terminus there.


    You can access the district on foot by crossing the Donaukanal, which runs
    along the border between the [[Vienna/Innere Stadt|Innere Stadt]] and
    Leopoldstadt or Brigittenau via the numerous bridges. The {{rint|vienna|U4}}
    line, which stops along the Donaukanal, can take you to Wien
    Mitte/Landstrasse, where you can drop your luggage (depending on the airline
    you travel on) and board the City Airport Train on your way out of Vienna.
    Tram lines 1 and 2 also run along the Donaukanal (and along the Ring), and
    continue to the Inner East – the line 2 to Brigittenau, while line 1 ends up
    in the middle of the Prater park.


    ==Get around==

    {{Mapframe|48.22547|16.39194|zoom=13}}

    {{mapshape|wikidata=Q259120,Q265655}}

    {{Mapshapes|Q209400}} &lt;!-- U-bahn --&gt;


    The district is served by U-Bahn lines U1 (southwest-northeast from
    [[Vienna/Innere Stadt|Innere Stadt]] to [[Vienna/Outer East|Donaustadt]])
    and U2 (northwest-southeast from the Ring around the [[Vienna/Innere
    Stadt|Innere Stadt]] to Aspern in [[Vienna/Outer East|Donaustadt]]). Both
    lines stop at the Praterstern.


    The U1 is most useful to get to the Leopoldstadt from the old town and the
    Hauptbahnhof. U2 can be useful to get to the southern part of Donau's
    waterfront and the attractions there (''Donaumarina''), the
    Ernst-Happel-Stadium, as well as the Messe.


    Tram lines run along the Taborstrasse/Dresdner Strasse (line 2),
    Wallensteinstrasse/Norwestabhnstrasse/Nordbahnstrasse (line 5), and numerous
    streets in the northern part of Leopoldstadt (extension of lines 2 and 5, as
    well as lines 31 and 33). Tram line 1 has a terminus in the southern end of
    the Prater park, at ''Prater Hauptallee''.


    The southern part of Leopoldstadt is scarcely served by public
    transportations and if you want to get in or out of there and you are not
    anywhere close to an U2 station, you need to use the buses, walk, drive or
    take a taxi.

    It has 15 gondolas, some of which are incredibly ornate and large enough to

    | content=Founded at the pleasure of the Habsburgs. On 20 July 1498, Emperor
    Maximilian decided to hire six singing boys, the first permanent boys choir
    attached to the court. He also made arrangements for their education –
    fringe benefits that are difficult to get from a modern employer. The choir
    served the monarchy until its demise at the beginning of the First World
    War. The last Imperial Chaplain, Monsignor Josef Schnitt reestablished the
    Boys Choir in 1924 as a private institution. To earn money, the choir began
    to perform outside the Imperial Chapel. Even though they are a
    not-for-profit organization, the rising costs of educating the choristers
    from a very young age as well as providing music required establishing the
    Verein Wiener Sängerknaben necessary. The choir sings high mass every Sunday
    morning (Sep-Jun) at the '''Hofburgkapelle''' (''Imperial Chapel'') in the
    Imperial Palace, and appears regularly at evening concerts in the
    '''Musikverein'''.

    | content=&lt;p&gt;Run by Reed Exhibitions, who operate fairgrounds
    throughout Austria, Vienna's fairgrounds are not as known for major events
    as the ones in Frankfurt, Munich or Hannover, but still play host to many
    events important to the Austrian, Central European and German-speaking
    markets. The fairgrounds were completely reconstructed at the turn of the
    millennium and a new rotunda with a part of the historic Messeturm lattice
    tower placed on top was built at the main entrance, providing a beacon
    visible from afar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fairgrounds are quite large, with
    four main halls, a congress centre and three entrances, close to U-Bahn
    stations Messe/Prater and Krieau on the U2. If there is an interesting event
    there, this may serve as a rainy-day alternative for the Prater amusement
    park. Most events happen January through May and October/November. Check the
    [http://www.messe.at/en/kalender/index.html?modus=7 calendar] if the event
    is of interest and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

    | content=Situated on a corner plot between the Prater park and the Messe
    Wien trade fair grounds, the Motel One is a chain hotel focusing on
    inexpensive accommodation in pleasant, modern settings. Expect the familiar
    brown-and-blue theme and small but functional rooms. Some rooms have views
    of the Riesenrad, but as the hotel does not differentiate between its rooms,
    you have to negotitate with the front desk to get one. The hotel only opened
    in December 2013, so it is relatively new amongst Vienna's hotels.

    | content=Despite the name, the ibis Wien Messe is not really closer to the
    Messe than the Suite Novotel next door, and it is rather on the wide
    Lasallestrasse affording good connections to the Innere Stadt and
    Donaustadt. It is a rather modern ibis with a nice restaurant and typical
    ibis rooms.

    | content=The ibis budget is the ultra-low-cost version of the ibis just
    next door. This is a newly-built hotel rather than a converted Etap Hotel,
    so it features the new-style green rooms, with a shower cabin directly
    accessible from the room and the sink right in the room. Rooms are
    15&amp;nbsp;sqm and can accommodate up to three people (third in the bunk
    bed), and come with free WiFi but no breakfast.

    radio, safety deposit box, minibar and free of charge WLAN, a small workout
    gym and a business-meeting room, breakfast buffet until 11:00. Most of the

    | content=Hotel Stefanie claims to be the oldest hotel in Vienna, in
    operation for over 400 years. It features classic vienesse style, relatively
    small rooms of irregular shapes (most with view of a small courtyard) and
    sumptous breakfasts. Expect classic vienesse hospitality, with a hint of
    pride, rather than modern comforts.&lt;br&gt;There is a tram stop in front
    of the hotel and a church next door, so it is not exactly the quietest hotel
    in Vienna.

    Novotel rooms in the chain's older standard. Rooms that face the inner
    courtyard have not much of a view Otherwise there isn't much to be said
    about this hotel that would not apply to other Novotels.

    the Suite Novotel offers fully furnished apartments with a mini-kitchenette
    suitable for longer stays. It is located on the district's main
    thoroughfare, the Lasallestrasse linking the Innere Stadt with the east bank
    of the Donau, next door to ibis and ibis budget, although the official
    address is that of a side street. This is one of the older-style Suite
    Novotels, with somewhat outdated decor.

    | content=The addition of &quot;Prater&quot; to the hotel's name may be a
    bit confusing, as the hotel is at the southern end of the Messe Wien trade
    fair grounds, far away from the Prater funfair. It is also far away from
    pretty much everything but the Messe. Otherwise, the location is pleasant,
    over an artificial pond in a new block of modern buildings on the
    fairgrounds' edge.

    | checkin= | checkout= | price=€89, breakfast €17

    | content=The Mercure is in the northwestern part of Leopoldstadt, in an
    inconspicious 1970s building close to the Donaukanal. The Superior and
    Privilege rooms are nice and modern, while the Standard rooms are garish
    with liberal use of red paint, so you will probably want to splurge on the
    €10 rate difference. WiFi is free throughout the hotel.

    | content=The spectacular Sofitel, towering over the Donaukanal is one of
    the few tall buildings with direct view of the Innere Stadt and the towers
    of Stephansdom. Designed by the famed architect Jean Nouvel, it became a
    landmark itself, especially for the spectacular painted and lit ceilings
    over the 5th and top floors. The glazed Le Loft restaurant is visible from
    afar in the night and offers brilliant views throughout the days and nights
    so much that it is hard to get a table on most evenings. Other facilities
    include a spa and fitness centre and free Wi-Fi. The hotel is non-smoking
    throughout and accepts pets on request. Public parking €30/day.

    | image=Danube-Vienna 2843.jpg

    | content=The Hilton's name is absolutely correct, as it is the part of
    Vienna's waterfront. Vienna faces away from the Danube, so when staying
    there you are not really close to anything but the river. You do, however,
    get a very unusual experience for the densely built-up Vienna of staying in
    a waterfront hotel with relaxing terraces and even an outdoor pool. The
    rooms facing the river have a view of the green Donauinsel, which provides
    for a very non-urban experience.

    }}


    ==Stay Safe==

    This area of Vienna is very safe, even at night, and no problems should
    occur here at all.


    The one exception to this is the Praterstern train station, which many
    Viennese locals tend to avoid at night. Although it gets quite shady at
    night and it's best to avoid it during that time, nothing should really
    happen to you as long as you have basic common sense. A police station is
    nearby as well. Its also wise to avoid the Prater at night.


    ==Go next==

    The obvious place to go next inside of Vienna is [[Vienna/Innere
    Stadt|Innere Stadt]]. The other possibility is to continue outside the Ring
    to [[Vienna/Outer East]].
